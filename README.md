# 🇹🇷 Ramadan in Istanbul: Journeying for the Soul

## Project Overview

This project is a single-page, fully **responsive travel inspiration website** created as the final portfolio piece for the **SheCodes Responsive workshop**. It focuses on experiencing the final nights of Ramadan in the historical and vibrant city of Istanbul, Turkey.

The core goal was to implement the principles of **responsive design** using modern HTML and CSS, ensuring a seamless and beautiful viewing experience across all screen sizes—from mobile phones to large desktop displays.

## ✨ Key Features & Technical Highlights

- **Responsive Design:** Implements **CSS Media Queries** to adapt the layout, images, and grid structures for optimal viewing on any device.
- **CSS Grids & Flexbox:** Used extensively for organising the content, eateries (`.eateries`), and footer sections (`.footer-grid`).
- **Multi-Language Functionality:** Demonstrates proficiency in language switching (English, Spanish, and Arabic).
  - **JavaScript** handles the dynamic URL redirection based on the selected option's `data-url` attribute.
  - **CSS** applies specific selectors (`html[lang="ar"]`) to manage font families and styling for **RTL (Right-to-Left)** languages like Arabic, ensuring correct internationalisation.
- **Semantic HTML:** Structured with clear sections (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) and semantic elements.

## 💖 Personal Inspiration

This project is a piece of **aspirational travel planning** for a future family trip. As I'm interested in languages, I wanted to experiment with providing translations to make the site welcoming to a broader audience. The site serves as a digital mood board for a culture-rich holiday during a special time of the year.
